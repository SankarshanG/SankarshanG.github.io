                    <p>I love all the aspects of the game of basketball. From the smell of the hardwood court to the echo of the ball bouncing against the floor. From the swish of the net as the ball slides through, to the squeaky athletic shoes when making a sharp turn. But there is no element to love more in basketball than the competitive spirit that is gained from each practice and to each game. Winning has a price, I realized that if I wanted to be great I had to be willing to sacrifice my time and energy. "The moment you give up is the moment you let someone else win."- Kobe Bryant. As I look in the mirror every day, that quote is what I live by. I will never give up because I know Kobe Bryant wouldn't give up either.</p>
                    <p>Growing up I played on an outside court in my front yard visualizing playing in the NBA and the crowd cheering with the T.V. broadcasters exclaiming about the dribble moves I just performed with the crowd's "oooh's" as I scored the ball. I played every single day and during the times I wasn't playing I was daydreaming about basketball. I taught myself how to play and learn different moves from watching the NBA games on T.V. As the obsession grew over this leather ball I got better and started to play club basketball. I learned the essential skills that I never knew before because I have never really played in a team setting before.
                    </p>
                    <p> From then till now I am still that same kid that obsesses over that leather ball if not more than ever. I love it so dearly and it is my source of happiness and escape from reality. I am playing at a varsity level for my club and have gained new friends throughout my experience of playing basketball, therefore I will always be improving because I love that leather ball.</p>
